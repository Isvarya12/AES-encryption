# AES-encryption

Code for AES encryptiom with following steps:
1.The plaintext is divided into blocks.
2.SubBytes: implements the byte substitution.
3.Shift rows: Each row is shifted a specific number of times.
4.Mix columns: matrix multiplication is performed, where each column is multiplied with a matrix.
5.Add round keys.
